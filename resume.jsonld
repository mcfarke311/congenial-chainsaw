  "description": "Kevin McFarland is a mid-level validation engineer with over four years of experience. He graduated from Clemson University with a Bachelor's Degree in computer engineering and started his career in South Carolina working for Intel. While there, he lightly touched PCI-e and virtualization, but automation quickly became his primary focus. Kevin moved to Austin, Texas and has been working with the automation infrastructure ever since. Kevin has been awarded four awards for automation and execution as well as for his work with continuous integration and building. When not at work, Kevin is probably hacking away on some code, playing with his 3d-printer, watching Netflix, or fixing something around the house or on his vehicles.",
